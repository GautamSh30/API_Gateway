frontend - middle-end - backend

- we need an intermediate layer b/w client side and microservices
- using the middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
- we can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- we try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
